# Cast-el

This project was imported using the **Unity 2020.3.x** empty base project.
This is a One-Button Game made in Unity.

You play Cast-el and are automatically moving through the dungeons off a castle, trying to find an exit. On your way, you are disturbed by the Caster who wants to cast you for his show. You can only walk right and downwards, the Caster can only walk upwards and left. If he gets you, you're done.
